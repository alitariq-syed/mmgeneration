# Overview

MMGeneration is a powerful toolkit for generative models, including GANs and diffusion models. It is based on PyTorch and [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv). The master branch works with [**PyTorch 1.5+**](https://pytorch.org/).

## supported tasks

Now, MMGeneration support 4 tasks of image generation. Lists are as follows.

- Unconditional GANs
- Conditional GANs
- Image2Image Translation
- Internal Learning
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models

## highlight

- **High-quality Training Performance:** MMGeneration currently support training on Unconditional GANs, Conditional GANs, Internal GANs, Image Translation Models, and diffusion models.
- **Powerful Application Toolkit:** A toolkit that provides plentiful applications to users. MMGeneration supports GAN interpolation, GAN projection, GAN manipulations and many other popular GAN's applications. It's time to play with your GANs!
